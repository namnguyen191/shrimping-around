    "description": "A rare and breathtaking freshwater shrimp, admired for its deep, metallic blue coloration that exudes a sense of luxury and sophistication. Its sleek, elongated body is covered in a rich, sapphire blue hue with a glossy, metallic finish, giving it an almost iridescent quality as it reflects light. This blue can range from dark, stormy shades to brighter, more vibrant tones. The shrimp often has intricate white or light blue patterning on its head and tail."
