    "description": "A rare and striking freshwater shrimp species native to Sulawesi, Indonesia. It is most well-known for its distinctive bright yellow coloration around its cheeks, head and claw, which contrasts with its mostly dark red body. This shrimp species is prized for its vivid color and unique appearance, but due to its sensitivity to water conditions, it is best suited for experienced aquarists."
