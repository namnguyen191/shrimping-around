    "description": "A selectively bred variant of the Golden Bee shrimp. These shrimp are known for their striking, pure white coloration, which gives them an elegant and ghostly appearance. Unlike the more common Crystal Red or Crystal Black shrimp, which have contrasting red or black patterns, Snow White shrimp are almost entirely white, making them stand out in aquariums, especially against dark substrates or lush green plants."
