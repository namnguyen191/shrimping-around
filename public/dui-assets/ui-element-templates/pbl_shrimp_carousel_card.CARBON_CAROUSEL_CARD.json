    "description": "A selectively bred variant of the Caridina cantonensis species, specifically a high-grade form of the Crystal Black Shrimp (CBS). These shrimp are valued for their intense black and white coloration, similar to their red counterpart, the Pure Red Line (PRL) shrimp. PBL shrimp are bred to ensure genetic purity, which means they come from pure black lines without crossbreeding with other shrimp species or color variations."
