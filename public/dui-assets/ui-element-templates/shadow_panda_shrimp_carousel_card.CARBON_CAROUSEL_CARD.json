    "description": "Prized for its unique black-and-white coloration that resembles the markings of a panda. Its glossy black body is accented by distinct white bands or patches, usually on its head, midsection, and tail. These white areas often have a slightly bluish tint, giving the shrimp a \"shadowed\" appearance that sets it apart from other panda shrimp varieties. "
