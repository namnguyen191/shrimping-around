    "body": "Caridina shrimp is a genus of freshwater shrimp belonging to the family Atyidae. These shrimp are popular in the aquarium hobby due to their small size, usually around 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) long, vibrant colors, and peaceful nature.\n\nThey require stable water parameters, particularly in terms of temperature, pH, and hardness, and some species are sensitive to water quality, making them suitable for experienced aquarists. They feed on biofilm, algae, and specialized shrimp food.",
