    "description": "Prized in the aquarium hobby for its deep, solid black coloration, the most distinguishing feature of Black Rose shrimp is their rich black or dark purple appearance. They are selectively bred to achieve this solid color, which can vary slightly between individuals. Some may have a deep, velvety black, while others might exhibit a very dark shade of purple or brown."
